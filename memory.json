    "text": "An infon is the smallest possible unit of information - a primitive fact. it has no meaning by itself; it only becomes meaningful when combined with other infons through patterns, relations, or processes, You can think of infons as the atoms of information. They carry a minimal state ( true/false, present/absent, value/no value ). They interact with impulses or mechanisms to create higher-level structures. Awareness emerges only when enough infons form coherent, stable patterns. Infons dont think, but they create the conditions from which thinking becomes possible.",
